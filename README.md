# Co2-Emission-Visualization

I have created an interactive bar graph visualization for the Co2 emission in 2014 for 10 Countries. 
index.html contains more information about the type of data, the countries chosen, and data provenance. 

I have used d3.js inside the indo.js file. It is used to create a bar graph with the sorting, filtering, and reset features. 

stylea6.css is used to give style to the bar graph and the HTML file. 

The data is loaded from a6barchart.tsv. The same data is also uploaded in a6barchart.csv for better understanding.
